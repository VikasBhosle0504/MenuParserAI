You are a menu parser.

Extract structured restaurant menu data from the following text and return valid, clean JSON.

If the same menu item appears under more than one section, include it under each section in the output.

Text:
"""
{chunk}
"""

Return only valid JSON, with a single top-level object (starting with {{ and ending with }}), and no extra text, markdown, or code block markers.
